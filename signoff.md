## Authorship declaration

I wrote this sign-off entirely without AI assistance.

## How to fill this in

For each commit, pick the line that matches what actually happened. Mix is expected — a submission that claims "I have read this fully" on every single commit is treated as a calibration failure, not a strength signal. Honest accounting earns more credit than performed thoroughness.

Use one of these line shapes:

- ✅ **`<sha>` — I have read this. I checked <specific things>. I would stake my name on it shipping to a 1.5k-RPS production system tonight.**
- ⚠️ **`<sha>` — I have read most of this. I'm confident on <X> but uncertain on <Y>. I'd want <a code reviewer / a load test / a property-based test> before staking my name on prod.**
- ❌ **`<sha>` — I have NOT fully read this. Claude generated it and I accepted because <specific reason — e.g. "boilerplate scaffolding", "test fixtures I will re-verify before merge"). Risks I accept: <named risks>.**

Be specific about what you actually checked — *"I read it"* without naming what you looked for is worth less than *"I checked the SQL parameterization, the WHERE clause against the IDOR fix in commit X, and ran the integration test against an in-memory DB"*.

## Sign-offs


⚠️ `7e19b22` — I'm confident on the auth fix in auth.ts, it was an easy to verify, I also tested the dashboard in the web explorer and console. I understand the general logic in orders-dal.ts and metrics.ts, BUT I can't fully explain the SQL logic or fix line-by-line, I don't feel confident in that fix, I'd want a code reviewer on the orders-dal.ts changes before staking my name on prod.

## What this artifact measures

The signal is not "did you read every line" — that's not what an architect does. The signal is **whether you can honestly account for what you read, what you trusted, and what you took on faith** — and whether the language you use is first-person ownership ("I accepted") rather than tool-deflection ("Claude wrote it"). The latter is what we score.
